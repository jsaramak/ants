# ====== USAGE EXAMPLE ==============================================
#
# (in e.g. ipython shell, or in a Jupyter Notebook)

# import ants
# alltypes=["eworker","queen","lateworker","malepupa","queenpupa","workerpupa"] # all ant types in data
# antdict=ants.load_relatedness_data(filename="MYLA_allSamples_Genotypes.txt",colonyfilter='MY')  # reads data for the MY supercolony
# net_workers_MY=ants.antnet(antdict,anttypes=["eworker"],reftypes=alltypes) # generates a network for early workers in MY, using early workers and queens for background relateness
# coords = ants.readcoords()
# rshuffle_workers_MY=ants.shuffled_rvalues_conserve(antdict,100,anttypes=["eworker"],reftypes=alltypes) # generates 100 reference nets between early workers with ants randomly shuffled between nests
# ants.plot_map_network_pvalue(net_workers_MY,coords,rshuffle_workers_MY,show='MY')

# ======= PYNET NETWORK FORMAT =======================================
#
# The object net (a pynet.Symmnet object) returns the relatedness between
# sites i and j as follows: net[i][j]
# Note that we add 1.0 to relatedness values because a relatedness of 0.0
# would be interpreted as missing link. So subtract 1.0 whenever necessary.
